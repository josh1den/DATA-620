# Network And Sentiment Analysis of Pitchfork Album Reviews, 2018-2023

In this project, I will analyze data from 6000 Pitchfork reviews from 2018 to 2023. 

[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/) is a highly influential, industry-leading online music publication producing original album reviews in addition to features, news articles, and more. Pitchfork's album review ratings system assigns a score from 0 to 10 based on internal polling. An album review score can have significant effect on artist's careers, affecting sales and marketing, live touring and festival opportunities, licensing placement and fees, digital streamining playlists and radio pickup, physical distribution orders, future partnership opportunities and terms, and more.

I have acquired this [data](https://github.com/josh1den/DATA-620/tree/main/FINAL_PROJECT/data) by writing an original [script](https://github.com/josh1den/DATA-620/tree/main/FINAL_PROJECT/scripts) identifying the review pages and extracting the following data fields:

- **Artist**, *the artist name*
- **Album**, *the album being reviewed*
- **Genre**, *the genre of music*
- **Label**, *the record label releasing the album*
- **Release Year**, *the year the album is released*
- **Author**, *the writer of the review*
- **Published**, *publishing date of the review*
